# Google-Drive-Magic

This is a simulation on how to access and filter out contents of your google drive. 

The [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Google-Drive-Magic/blob/main/GDrive%20access.ipynb) gives the idea about how can you get the required data from your google drive and sort it out. 

The file shows how can you find data using labels of the files, how to get your required data by matching text in the files, audio or video in the files.
